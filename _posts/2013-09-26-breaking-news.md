Dear reader, today we have a lot of things to announce!

First, you may have noticed the website. It has been completely redesigned by Matthieu.
And we now have a blog (you are reading its first post!) where we can write about:

- **the company**: the creation process in France and major announcements
- **our work**: new projects, releases and updates
- **business**: thoughts and facts about the video game industry and apps markets
- **tech**: focus on a technology that worth it, via tutorials or thoughts

Now, about the company. We have decided to wait January 2014 to officialy and legally create Pixelnet Studio. This is the best we can do to optimize some expenses, like taxes.

Finally, the most interesting part: projects!
We have often heard the question "Hum, what are you doing guys?", so here is an exhaustive summary of our activity.

# The Koikoukesse

For now, we are not working on this project anymore.

We tried Xamarin, a mobile cross platform technology to make applications in C#, but we finally were not satisfied with the result. The main issue was the deployment time, even on simulator. It was a real pain to tweak an animation or a particle effect.

# Unity

We'd rather want to focus on more risky but fun projects, like George or others, as long as we can. This imply a major technology change: we now use Unity for games.

The tool is great and convinced us to use it. With the incoming 2D tools, we decided to learn and master it.

## George: Le pirate

After the Stunfest 2013 demo, we gathered gameplay ideas to make a better and full game. We are rebuilding the game from scratch (with Unity), changing some minor gameplay parts.

We will try an incremental way to develop, adding or changing features one after another.

## Bunny Splash

Another Unity-made prototype, focused on local multiplayer party. For now it is somewhere between Jump'n'Bump and Smash Bros. Who knows where it will lead us?
Well, we have plans. But that's another story!

As you can see, we are pretty busy!
Stay tuned!
