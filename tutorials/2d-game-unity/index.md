Using the brand new **Unity** native 2D tools, you will learn how to make a small "Shoot'Em Up" (abbreviated to _shmup_ thereafter) with this tutorial.

The result will be a lot like this demo:

_(Click on the image to play)_

I will focus on a _shmup_ with an horizontal scrolling. However, if this tutorial do its job correctly, you'll understand how to extend the code to many other genres.

The assets, gameplay and original idea come from the game [The Great Paper Adventure][tgpa_link]. I created this game a few years ago using [XNA][xna_link]. When I started this tutorial, I thought it was a perfect material to explain Unity.

# Unity

This tutorial is made with the Unity 4.3 **FREE** version.
