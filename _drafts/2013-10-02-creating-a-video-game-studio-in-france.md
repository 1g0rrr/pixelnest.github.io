title: Creating a video game studio in France
subtitle: or why is there so few french indie game developers
---

It's been nearly six months since Matthieu and I decided to create our own studio to make video games and mobile/web apps.

We knew this wouldn't be easy and we are still searching for **the** game idea that will deserve one year of hard work.

But we learned a lot about the company creation process and the video games ecosystem in France. 

# The french company creation process

At first, it seems simple. 

All the law ask you is to choose a status made of few letters (EIRL, SARL, SA...) and to fill a paper.

But the status will determine the taxes type (individual or company) and rate and their rates you will pay. 

And this is not free: from a hundred to two thousands euro, depending if you do everything yourself or if you ask a lawyer or an accountant to do it.

Well, we can handle the cost.

If it was the only one. But as an entrepreneur, you pay around 45% taxes of your revenue. This is quite fair, except the two first years: you pay even when you gain nothing.
And as a software or game developer, you will be likely to gain nothing the first years as you need to create a valuable product.

So add a couple of thousands euro to the bill, for each founder. Great.
