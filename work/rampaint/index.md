RAMPAINT is a multiplayer-platformer-fighter game for your couch, friends and TV.

It involves explosions, powershards and giant avatars.

Remember the unforgettable nights playing [Smash Bros](http://www.smashbros.com/) with your friends? We aim to create something this good.

It is currently _in development_ (and far from complete) and should be released during the year 2014. When it's done.

Meanwhile, you can watch an [early gameplay footage of the game on YouTube](http://youtu.be/Wee-F32Zcp0).


<br />Follow our [journal](/journal) to keep yourself updated about the game. ;)
